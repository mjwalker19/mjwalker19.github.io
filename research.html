    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> It is difficult to write a perfect contract. Contracts are often renegotiable and parties to a contract may understand their obligations differently. When these differences are important, disputes over buyer and seller non-performance arise. This paper addresses non-performance issues in procurement, by developing a flexible price contract structure that contains an arbitration clause. I embed this structure into a procurement interaction, where the contract price bounds are determined under competitive conditions. The theoretical results suggest that there exists a contingent contract, defined by the degree of price flexibility and the probability of arbitration, for which trade is efficient. This contract is robust in that it relies only on the regard of each party to their own interest. I test the predictions of the model in a laboratory experiment and find support for several comparative statics in the data. Interestingly, the shadow of an arbitrator crowds out buyer reciprocity, and so a contingent contract does not increase trade efficiency relative to a flexible-price contract that contains only non-binding incentives. The findings have managerial implications for the establishment of trust and procurement efficiencies driven by competition. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> When product quality is unverifiable by third parties, enforceable contracts that condition price upon quality are not feasible. If higher quality is also costly to deliver, moral hazard by sellers flourishes, particularly when procurement is via a competitive auction process. Retainage is a contractual mechanism that presents a solution to the third-party unverifiability problem, by setting aside a portion of the purchase price. After delivery, the buyer has sole discretion over the amount of retainage money that is released to the seller. While generally a feasible contract form to implement, retainage introduces a moral hazard for the buyer. We use laboratory experiments to investigate how and when retainage might be successfully used to facilitate trust and trustworthiness in procurement contracts. We observe that retainage induces a significant improvement in product quality when there are some trustworthy buyers in the population, consistent with a model of fair payment norms that we develop. This improvement is realized at the cost of increased buyer-seller profit inequalities. We also observe that at high levels of retainage, there is a welfare-decreasing market unraveling in which sellers do not bid on contracts. Our results imply that retainage incentives can mitigate the tension between competition and cooperation arising from reverse auctions, but only at appropriate levels of retainage.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We examine how the emergence of Covid-19 in Wuhan, and the ramifications of associated events, influence pro-sociality, trust and attitudes towards risk and ambiguity. We assess these influences using an experiment consisting of financially incentivized economic tasks. We establish causality via the comparison of a baseline sample collected pre-epidemic with five sampling waves starting from the imposition of a stringent lockdown in Wuhan and completed six weeks later. We find significant long-term increases - measured as the difference between the baseline and final wave average responses - in altruism, cooperation, trust and risk tolerance. Participants who remained in Wuhan during the lockdown exhibit lower trust and cooperation relative to other participants. We identify transitory effects from two events that permeated the public psyche. First, in the immediate aftermath of the Wuhan lockdown, there is a decrease in trust and an increase in ambiguity aversion. Second, the news of a high-profile whistleblower's death also decreases trust while heightening risk aversion. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Access to information via social media is one of the biggest differentiators of public health crises today. During the early stages of the Covid-19 outbreak in January 2020, we conducted an experiment in Wuhan, China to assess the impact of viral social media content on pro-social and trust behaviours and preferences towards risk and ambiguity. Prior to the experiment, participants viewed one of two videos that had been widely and anonymously shared on Chinese social media: a central government leader visiting a local hospital and supermarket, or health care volunteers transiting to Wuhan. In a control condition, participants watched a neutral video, unrelated to the crisis. Viewing one of the leadership or volunteer videos leads to higher levels of pro-sociality and increased ambiguity aversion relative to the control condition. The leadership video, however, induces lower levels of trust. We provide evidence from two post-experiment surveys that the video’s impact on pro-sociality is modulated by influencing the viewer’s affective emotional state.</div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We conduct an experiment in which subjects play an ultimatum game but, rather than bargaining over money, they bargain over lottery tickets for a prize. Compared to the standard ultimatum game, proposers offer a significantly lower percentage of lottery tickets, which is inconsistent with either ex ante or ex post fairness. In contrast, responders have a significantly higher acceptance threshold, which is consistent with ex post fairness. By varying the timing of the accept/reject decision of responders, we also show that intentions matter and present evidence of a choice anomaly in responder preferences concerning their willingness to accept extreme inequality. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Typically, in first-price auctions, a deviation of one’s bid above the risk neutral Nash equilibrium (RNNE) is attributed to risk aversion and the degree of risk aversion attributed to that individual bidder is monotonically increasing in that individual’s deviation from RNNE. A problem with that approach is that the deviation from RNNE could be due to any number of reasons that are not related to risk-preference. We propose a more robust method of identifying the role of individual risk preferences in first-price auctions. The method involves bidding against a computerized opponent (i.e., a random number generator) in a sequence of first-price auctions. Within-subject, comparing auctions with different upper bounds on the computerized opponent’s bid space allows us to cleanly isolate risk-aversion as a driver of behaviour. This is because a risk-averse bidder is expected to behave differently in the two settings, and a risk-neutral bidder is expected to behave the same in both settings. We observe significantly lower bids when the opponent’s bid space is restricted, which is consistent with the predicted best response functions given risk aversion. To establish robustness, we compare our characterizations to the theoretical predictions for bids that arise out of a separate Holt-Laury risk-elicitation task. We also provide evidence that related experience obtained in the field is associated with a fall in bidding aggression independently of risk preferences, but that this does not necessarily result in bids closer to the RNNE.</div></p>
