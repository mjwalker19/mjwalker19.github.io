    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> I analyse the effects of a contingent contract, implemented via an arbitration mechanism, in a procurement auction setting. With no contingency in the contract, a seller moral hazard problem arises, and trade is inefficient. It is shown that there exists a contingent contract, defined by the degree of price flexibility and the probability of arbitration, for which trade is efficient in the unique equilibrium outcome. This outcome benefits the buyer, who holds the balance of market power, suggesting that commonly held beliefs about the fairness benefits of arbitration may not apply in competitive procurement interactions. I test the main predictions of the model in a laboratory experiment. Consistent with the theory, bidding is more aggressive and high quality is incentive compatible with a contingent contract. Yet the arbitrator crowds out buyer reciprocity and the contingent contract yields no significant increase in trade efficiency relative to a non-contingent contract. A sizeable fraction of buyers exhibit reference-dependent fairness preferences. The findings have implications for the establishment of trust and procurement efficiencies driven by competition. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> When product quality is unverifiable by third parties, enforceable contracts that condition price upon quality are not feasible. If higher quality is also costly to deliver, moral hazard by sellers flourishes, particularly when procurement is via a competitive auction process. Retainage is a contractual mechanism that presents a solution to the third-party unverifiability problem, by setting aside a portion of the purchase price. After delivery, the buyer has sole discretion over the amount of retainage money that is released to the seller. While generally a feasible contract form to implement, retainage introduces a moral hazard for the buyer. We use laboratory experiments to investigate how and when retainage might be successfully used to facilitate trust and trustworthiness in procurement contracts. We observe that retainage induces a significant improvement in product quality when there are some trustworthy buyers in the population, consistent with a model of fair payment norms that we develop. This improvement is realized at the cost of increased buyer-seller profit inequalities. We also observe that at high levels of retainage, there is a welfare-decreasing market unraveling in which sellers do not bid on contracts. Our results imply that retainage incentives can mitigate the tension between competition and cooperation arising from reverse auctions, but only at appropriate levels of retainage.</div></p>

    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We conduct an experiment in which subjects play an ultimatum game but, rather than bargaining over money, they bargain over lottery tickets for a prize. Compared to the standard ultimatum game, proposers offer a significantly lower percentage of lottery tickets, which is inconsistent with either ex ante or ex post fairness. In contrast, responders have a significantly higher acceptance threshold, which is consistent with ex post fairness. By varying the timing of the accept/reject decision of responders, we also show that intentions matter and present evidence of a choice anomaly in responder preferences concerning their willingness to accept extreme inequality. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We examine how the emergence of Covid-19 in Wuhan, and the ramifications of associated events, influence pro-sociality, trust and attitudes towards risk and ambiguity. We assess these influences using an experiment consisting of financially incentivized economic tasks. We establish causality via the comparison of a baseline sample collected pre-epidemic with five sampling waves starting from the imposition of a stringent lockdown in Wuhan and completed six weeks later. We find significant long-term increases - measured as the difference between the baseline and final wave average responses - in altruism, cooperation, trust and risk tolerance. Participants who remained in Wuhan during the lockdown exhibit lower trust and cooperation relative to other participants. We identify transitory effects from two events that permeated the public psyche. First, in the immediate aftermath of the Wuhan lockdown, there is a decrease in trust and an increase in ambiguity aversion. Second, the news of a high-profile whistleblower's death also decreases trust while heightening risk aversion. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> At the onset of an epidemic, can viral social media videos induce the high levels of trust and pro-sociality required for a successful community response? Shortly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Wuhan, China, we conducted an experiment assessing the impact of viral videos on individual preferences and pro-social behaviour. Prior to the experiment, participants viewed one of three videos culled from Chinese social media: a central government leader visiting a local hospital and supermarket, health care volunteers transiting to Wuhan, or an emotionally neutral video unrelated to the emergency. Viewing one of the first two videos leads to higher levels of pro-sociality and increased ambiguity aversion relative to the third video. The leadership video, however, induces lower levels of trust. Our results suggest ways to craft more effective crisis response efforts and provide insights into how the direction of information in hierarchies influences trust in community members.</div></p>
