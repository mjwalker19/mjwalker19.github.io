The study repeatedly applies a panel of financially incentivized individual and strategic decisions tasks via the WeChat social media platform to a population of preregistered Wuhan University students. We find that the initial outbreak, coupled with the lockdown of Wuhan City, leads to upticks in altruism, trust and ambiguity aversion, and downticks in risk aversion. Over the remaining samples we observe all measurements return to baseline levels except for risk aversion. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> In complex procurement projects, it is difficult to write enforceable contracts that condition price upon quality. If higher quality is also costly to deliver, moral hazard by sellers flourishes, particularly when procurement is via a competitive bidding process. An established incentive mechanism used to mitigate this problem in the construction industry is retainage, in which the buyer sets aside a portion of the purchase price. After project completion, the buyer determines the amount of retainage that is released to the seller, considering any defects that arise. While generally a feasible contract form to implement, the practical difficulties in assessing completion introduce a moral hazard for the buyer. We use laboratory experiments to understand when retainage can be used to mitigate the seller moral hazard problem in a two-tier supply chain. The results suggest that retainage can deliver a significant quality improvement but may inflate tender prices. In high retainage structures, there is a trade-off between trade efficiency and supplier participation in request for bids. We further develop a model of fair payment norms and offer managerial insights on how to design the retainage mechanism, conditional on prevailing levels of trust and beliefs about fairness.</div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We analyse how late payments affect market entry and price competition. Buyers first send a signal to potential suppliers about their intended payment date. Suppliers then decide whether to incur a fixed and irreversible cost to enter into price competition. After the seller and winning bid is determined, the buyer chooses the ex-post payment date, which may or may not coincide with the ex-ante date promised. We show theoretically that if firms discount payment received late, then payment delays feed into higher consumer prices and reduced competition. Reneging on a promise to pay on-time entails a penalty for the buyer set by a third-party. If this penalty is not set carefully, a welfare loss arises. We provide experimental evidence that the probability of a timely payment responds to the cost of reneging and free-riding behaviour emerges among weak buyers when the fine is not set high enough. We also show that seller over-entry can distort payment behaviours in the market. Our findings have implications for the horizontal effects of payment practices and for the design of regulatory interventions to deter late payments. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> It is difficult to write a perfect contract. Contracts are often incomplete and parties to a contract may understand their obligations differently. When these differences are important, disputes over non-performance arise. This paper studies a seller moral hazard problem in procurement auctions when contracts cannot be conditioned on outcomes. I develop a flexible price contract structure that contains an arbitration clause and embed this structure into a procurement interaction, where the contract price bounds are determined via a price-based auction process. The theoretical results suggest that there exists a contingent contract, defined by the degree of price flexibility and the probability of arbitration, which can mitigate the seller moral hazard problem. This contract relies only on the regard of each party to their own interest. I test the predictions of the model in a laboratory experiment and find support for several comparative statics in the data. Under the shadow of arbitration, bidding is more aggressive and high quality is the more profitable seller strategy. However, the arbitrator also crowds out buyer reciprocity and so a contingent contract does not increase trade efficiency relative to a contract based on implicit incentives. The findings have managerial implications for the establishment of trust and procurement efficiencies driven by competition. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Access to information via social media is one of the biggest differentiators of public health crises today. During the early stages of the Covid-19 outbreak in January 2020, we conducted an experiment in Wuhan, China to assess the impact of viral social media content on pro-social and trust behaviours and preferences towards risk and ambiguity. Prior to the experiment, participants viewed one of two videos that had been widely and anonymously shared on Chinese social media: a central government leader visiting a local hospital and supermarket, or health care volunteers transiting to Wuhan. In a control condition, participants watched a neutral video, unrelated to the crisis. Viewing one of the leadership or volunteer videos leads to higher levels of pro-sociality and increased ambiguity aversion relative to the control condition. The leadership video, however, induces lower levels of trust. We provide evidence from two post-experiment surveys that the video’s impact on pro-sociality is modulated by influencing the viewer’s affective emotional state.</div></p>

    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We present experimental evidence on how pro-sociality, trust and attitudes towards risk and ambiguity evolved over the six weeks following the imposition of stringent Covid-19 related lockdown measures in the Hubei province of China. We compare incentivized economic decision-making in a baseline sample, collected pre-epidemic, with a series of repeated cross-sectional samples drawn from the same population between January and March, 2020. We find high rates of altruism, cooperation and ambiguity aversion in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown, while trust is significantly below its baseline level. Risk attitudes also differ in the post-lockdown sample, with decreased risk tolerance in the loss domain and lesser risk aversion in the gain domain. We further uncover significant transitory effects for trust and risk aversion around the date of a high-profile whistleblower's death from Covid-19. Our findings suggest that lockdown policies may have unintended consequences for economic preferences that determine population compliance. </div></p>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We conduct an experiment in which subjects play an ultimatum game but, rather than bargaining over money, they bargain over lottery tickets for a prize. Compared to the standard ultimatum game, proposers offer a significantly lower percentage of lottery tickets, which is inconsistent with either ex ante or ex post fairness. In contrast, responders have a significantly higher acceptance threshold, which is consistent with ex post fairness. By varying the timing of the accept/reject decision of responders, we also show that intentions matter and present evidence of a choice anomaly in responder preferences concerning their willingness to accept extreme inequality. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> Typically, in first-price auctions, a deviation of one’s bid above the risk neutral Nash equilibrium (RNNE) is attributed to risk aversion and the degree of risk aversion attributed to that individual bidder is monotonically increasing in that individual’s deviation from RNNE. A problem with that approach is that the deviation from RNNE could be due to any number of reasons that are not related to risk-preference. We propose a more robust method of identifying the role of individual risk preferences in first-price auctions. The method involves bidding against a computerized opponent (i.e., a random number generator) in a sequence of first-price auctions. Within-subject, comparing auctions with different upper bounds on the computerized opponent’s bid space allows us to cleanly isolate risk-aversion as a driver of behaviour. This is because a risk-averse bidder is expected to behave differently in the two settings, and a risk-neutral bidder is expected to behave the same in both settings. We observe significantly lower bids when the opponent’s bid space is restricted, which is consistent with the predicted best response functions given risk aversion. To establish robustness, we compare our characterizations to the theoretical predictions for bids that arise out of a separate Holt-Laury risk-elicitation task. We also provide evidence that related experience obtained in the field is associated with a fall in bidding aggression independently of risk preferences, but that this does not necessarily result in bids closer to the RNNE.</div></p>
