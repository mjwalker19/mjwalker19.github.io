    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> We conduct an experiment in which subjects play an ultimatum game but, rather than bargaining over money, they bargain over lottery tickets for a prize. Compared to the standard ultimatum game, proposers offer a significantly lower percentage of lottery tickets, which is inconsistent with either ex ante or ex post fairness. In contrast, responders have a significantly higher acceptance threshold, which is consistent with ex post fairness. By varying the timing of the accept/reject decision of responders, we also show that intentions matter and present evidence of a choice anomaly in responder preferences concerning their willingness to accept extreme inequality. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> I analyse the effect of an arbitrator on the outcomes of renegotiable procurement contracts allocated at a price-based auction. If the seller has no contractual incentive to deliver high quality, trade is inefficient. It is shown that there exists a contingent contract, defined by the degree of contractual flexibility and the probability of arbitration, for which an efficient procurement outcome can be implemented in equilibrium. This contract exists independently of the arbitratorâ€™s preferences. The theoretical result holds so long as the cost of arbitration is low enough and the availability of an arbitrator is uncertain. This result has an interesting implication: guaranteeing the availability of an arbitrator can be welfare-decreasing. I test the predictive power of the model in a controlled laboratory experiment with human subjects. Consistent with the theory, bidding is observed to be more competitive and high quality to be incentive compatible in the presence of an arbitrator. Yet a contingent contract cannot increase procurement efficiency relative to a voluntary incentive arrangement. The arbitrator becomes a substitute for buyer reciprocity. There is evidence to suggest a significant fraction of buyers exhibit reference-dependent fairness preferences. The findings have implications for the establishment of contractual trust and procurement efficiencies driven by competition. </div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> When product quality is unverifiable by third parties, and at the same time high quality is costly to provide, it becomes impossible to condition purchasing contracts on provided quality. In these situations, moral hazard flourishes when procurement is made through price-based reverse auctions. We use laboratory experiments with human subjects to investigate how incentives can be aligned to facilitate trust and trustworthiness in procurement contracts. To do this, we embed a retainage provision into the procurement contract and simulate a two-sided moral hazard environment. Retainage is a common incentive mechanism to insure against low quality in the construction industry. Crucially, it does not impose a requirement to condition price on quality. We observe that retainage can induce an economically significant improvement in product quality, as predicted by a model of fair payment norms. This improvement was realized at the cost of increased profit inequalities. Informal procurement arrangements, characterized by high retainage, led to a welfare-decreasing market unraveling over time. Our results imply that a retainage mechanism can mitigate the tension between competition and cooperation arising from reverse auctions. It is, however, unable to yield a Pareto improvement.</div></p>

    Abstract   
    </button>   
    </p> 
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"> At the onset of an epidemic, can viral social media videos induce the high levels of trust and pro-sociality required for a successful community response? Shortly after the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in Wuhan, China, we conducted an experiment assessing the impact of viral videos on individual preferences and pro-social behaviour. Prior to the experiment, participants viewed one of three videos culled from Chinese social media: a central government leader visiting a local hospital and supermarket, health care volunteers transiting to Wuhan, or an emotionally neutral video unrelated to the emergency. Viewing one of the first two videos leads to higher levels of pro-sociality and increased ambiguity aversion relative to the third video. The leadership video, however, induces lower levels of trust. Our results suggest ways to craft more effective crisis response efforts and provide insights into how the direction of information in hierarchies influences trust in community members.</div></p>
